# Simplifi3dSettings

I'm tired of manually going through Old gcode and comparing what worked or what didn't. 
The goal of this project is to create a quick and easy to use program to show the difference in settings between 2 Simplify3d Gcode files, without any external comparison software like BeyondCompare.

Basically, I'm making it for me, if you can use it too great! Enjoy!
